## ATX Headings

# foo

## foo

### foo

bar

#### foo

bar

##### foo

###### foo

####### This isn't a heading

bar

#5 This isn't a heading

#This isn't a heading

## Failing Tests

Headings and horizontal rules are shrinked to three characters because this simplify the parsing - maybe we should change this.
