# Blockquotes

> Use it if you're quoting a person, a song or whatever.

foo

> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

- foo
- > bar
- baz

## Failing Tests

```
> You can use *italic* or lists inside them also.
And just like with other paragraphs,
all of these lines are still
part of the blockquote, even without the > character in front.

To end the blockquote, just put a blank line before the following
paragraph.
```

```
> - 1
> - 1
> - 1
```

```
* foo

  > This is a blockquote
  > inside a list item.

* bar`
```

```
> Use it if you're quoting a person, a song or whatever.

> You can use *italic* or lists inside them also.
