# MarkText

**MarkText** is an **open source** Markdown editor for OS X, released under the **MIT license**. It is inspired by outstanding markdown editor **Typora**.

### Why write another Markdown editor ?

1. Typora is so excellent that I love it so much that I cannot bear to part with it. But in the process of using Typora, I still find some small problems. As a programmer, I can't wait to fix these problems, because Typora is not an open source software. So I decided to write a self - used markdown editor and open source for all the people who love markdown.

2. As mentioned above, **MarkText** will be open source indefinitely. It is also hoped that all markdown lovers can contribute their own code, and develop **MarkText** into a popular markdown editor.

3. There are many markdown editors, and each editor has its own characteristics, but it is also difficult to satisfy all makdown users' needs. I hope **MarkText** can satisfy markdown users' needs as much as possible. Although the latest **MarkText** is still not perfect, but we are trying to make it perfect.
