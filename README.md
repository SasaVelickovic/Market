<h3 align="center">Why write another editor?</h3>

1. I love writing, I have used a lot of markdown editors,there is still not a editor can fully meet my needs, I don't like to be disturbed when I write, and some unbearable bug, **Mark Text** use virtual DOM to render the page, So it's high efficiency, and open source to friends all love markdown and writing.
2. As mentioned above, **Mark Text** will be open source indefinitely. It is also hoped that all markdown lovers can contribute their own code, and develop **Mark Text** into a popular markdown editor.
3. There are many markdown editors, and each editor has its own characteristics, but it is also difficult to satisfy all makdown users' needs. I hope **Mark Text** can satisfy markdown users' needs as much as possible. Although the latest **Mark Text** is still not perfect, but we are trying to make it perfect.
