#  Spelling

Mark Text can automatically check your text for misspelled words as you type and suggest corrections. You just need to enable spell checking in settings under *spelling* to never miss a misspelled word. We're using Hunspell for Linux and Windows and on macOS you can choose between Hunspell or the system spell checker (default). You can control the default proofing language via settings but can change the language at runtime via right-click menu `Change Language` entry under `Spelling` without changing the default language. By default Mark Text only support American English for Hunspell and the local available languages for macOS spell checker. You can download 42 languages for Hunspell and many more for macOS.

## Features

**Automatic language detection:**

Mark Text can try to automatically detect the language while typing and we're currently support over 160 languages by Compact Language Detector.

**Don't underline misspelled words:**

If you don't like that all spelling mistakes are red highlighted, you can disable this feature in settings but still benefit from manually spell checking via right-click menu. Disabling constantly spell checking will also improve performance overall.

**Adding words to dictionary:**

You can add words to the selected dictionary by right-clicking on a misspelled word and select `Add to Dictionary` or remove a previously added word. If you want to temporary ignore a word, select `Ignore`.

## Manage dictionaries
